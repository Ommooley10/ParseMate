# ParseMate   

## **A Powerful LL(1) Grammar Checker for English Sentences**  

ParseMate is an **intelligent English grammar checker** that combines **LL(1) parsing, dependency analysis, and NLP techniques** to assess **syntactic correctness and grammatical accuracy**. It identifies **sentence structure issues, missing dependencies (such as subject-verb agreements and required prepositions), and grammatical errors** using a combination of **Context-Free Grammar (CFG) rules, NLP models, and AI-powered suggestions**.  

With an **interactive GUI**, ParseMate provides a **user-friendly experience** for real-time grammar checking.

## **Tech Stack & Tools Used**  

ParseMate is built with **cutting-edge NLP and parsing technologies** to ensure accurate and efficient grammar checking.  

###  Python (Core Language) üêç
Python is chosen as the **primary language** due to its:  
- **Rich ecosystem** for Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
- **Powerful libraries** that support machine learning and text analysis.  
- **Ease of integration** with GUI frameworks like Tkinter.  

###  spaCy (NLP Processing)   
- A fast and robust NLP library used for:  
  - **Tokenization** (breaking text into words).  
  - **Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging** (identifying nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.).  
  - **Dependency parsing** (understanding relationships between words).  
- Helps dynamically extract **grammatical structures** from sentences.  

###  language-tool-python (Grammar Checking)   
- An AI-powered grammar checker used to:  
  - Detect **spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and stylistic issues**.  
  - Provide **contextual suggestions** to improve sentence correctness.  
- It acts as a **secondary layer of validation** after LL(1) parsing.  

###  LL(1) Parsing (Context-Free Grammar)   
- A **top-down parsing algorithm** used for:  
  - Validating sentence structure **based on predefined grammar rules (CFG)**.  
  - Ensuring **syntactic correctness** by checking if a sentence conforms to **English syntax**.  
- Helps **detect structural errors** that AI-based checkers might miss.  

###  Tkinter (GUI Framework)   
- A **lightweight and built-in Python library** used to create the graphical user interface (GUI).  
- Enables users to **enter a sentence, check its grammar, and view detailed results** in an intuitive way.  
- Provides an interactive and **easy-to-use** experience.
